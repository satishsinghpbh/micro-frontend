# Message Delivery Gateway

## Overview
`message-delivery-gateway` is a robust, enterprise-grade service responsible for managing outbound message delivery workflows in the GTM ecosystem. It processes messages from internal staging queues, applies business logic, and ensures reliable dispatch to downstream systems.

The project primarily interacts with the internal staging queue:  
**`GTM.MSG.OUTBOUND.STAGING`**, which acts as a buffer to handle outbound message flow efficiently and reliably.

---

## Key Features
- **Reliable Message Staging:** Messages are temporarily stored in the internal staging queue before delivery, ensuring durability and fault tolerance.
- **Outbound Message Processing:** Processes and dispatches messages to external systems or partner applications.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to support multiple message types and easy extensibility for future flows (e.g., file uploads, notifications).
- **Transactional Handling:** Ensures exactly-once or at-least-once delivery guarantees based on configuration.
- **Environment Support:** Supports multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod) with configurable queue bindings.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrated with monitoring tools for real-time health checks and alerts.

## Components

| Component                  | Description                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Staging Queue**           | `GTM.MSG.OUTBOUND.STAGING` - Internal message buffer for outbound data. |
| **Message Processor**       | Consumes messages from the staging queue, applies business rules, and routes outbound. |
| **Outbound Gateway Service**| Interface responsible for message delivery to downstream systems (e.g., APIs, MQ, databases). |
| **Error Handling Module**   | Handles failed messages, supports retries, and routes to DLQ if necessary. |
| **Configuration Module**    | Manages environment-specific properties and queue names. |
| **Monitoring & Logging**    | Tracks processing metrics, errors, and system health. |
